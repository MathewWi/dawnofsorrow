Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is a one of famous Castlevania games, and it is also the sequel to [1129M|Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA)].

This run aims for the fastest time to complete the game with the good ending, on normal difficulty.

by utilizing a variant of a famous zipping glitch.

! About the run

In fact, before I met DeSmuME-rerecording, I had never considered about the speedrun of the game.

One day, I wanted to try recording a DS TAS movie with a new emulator,
so I TASed the very beginning part of this game (the first battle against three enemies) just for curiosity.
I learned some of the basic mechanisms of the game through the recording, and
it told me that I can improve [=forum/p/200512#200512|Atma's demonstration TAS in the forum].
This is why I started working on the game suddenly. I had never expected that I would make a Castlevania TAS.

After I decided to work on the game, I watched [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4714qAvk4|Groobo's semi-TAS video] on YouTube (and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa0GjrK6KoY|Satoryu's non tool-assisted speedrun]).

The video completes the game in 28:58, by utilizing famous two glitches. One is a way to open a gate from the opposite side of a switch by Cutall's special attack, and the other is the one called "Succubus glitch" which allows us to go through/into a wall, and get a bunch of souls and items (details are described later).
