
Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is a one of famous Castlevania games,
and it is also the sequel to [1129M|Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA)].

This run aims for the fastest time to complete the game with the good ending, on normal difficulty.
The run starts with no predefined save, but it completes the game in 8 minutes and 20.11 seconds,
by utilizing a variant of a famous zipping glitch.
The in-game completion time of this run should be 00:07:18 (26310 frames),
but since game timers have been overwritten by a glitch,
it is shown as 00:43:43 after the game has been completed.

* Emulator used: [=forum/p/210670#210670|DeSmuME 0.9.4+]
** The game sometimes lags more than the real console, because of the emulator's inaccurate timing emulation.
** I recommend OpenGL. Both OpenGL and SoftRasterizer work well, but I think SoftRasterizer causes a minor display glitch.
* Aims for fastest time (to get the good ending)
* Abuses programming errors in the game / Uses zipping glitch
* Manipulates luck (for soul/item drops, boss moves, etc.)
* Takes damage to save time
* Genre: Action, Platform, RPG
* Colors a warp room

!! About the run

The run completes the game in the following process.

# Prologue
# Meet Yoko and Julius, obtain Magic Seal 1
# Obtain Axe from Axe Armor
# Defeat Flying Armor
# Defeat Balore
# Save game for later glitch use
# Obtain Magic Seal 2
# Defeat Dmitrii
# Perform zipping to collect achieve things and suspend/restart the game
# Go to Warp Room and warp to The Abyss. The castle will self-destruct in a few seconds

It is well known that the famous zipping glitch, which is called Succubus glitch,
allows you to obtain a bunch of souls and items immediately.
That Succubus glitch is used in a few of speedruns. However, they needed to get to
The Pinnacle to obtain Succubus soul.

While making this run, I invented a variation of Succubus glitch,
a method to interrupt special attack by a cutscene.
It allowed me to perform a zipping much earlier than before.
Moreover, I enthusiastically investigated what can be done by the zipping,
and I finally concluded that the last warp room can be activated and also Menace can be skipped.

Since the emulator generates a ridiculous amount of lags,
I did not mind lags and 1 frame losses very strictly
(still I generally did my best, of course!).
Instead, I tried to optimize the whole route/strategy hard,
and also to discover general tricks of the game.

!! Tricks

Here I show you what I have found.

! Backdash

There are two methods of move, backdash+jump and backdash+crouching.
I compared their average speeds to see which is faster. I show the comparison on flat ground below.

* Backdash+jump: (13784+13232+12680+12128+11576+11024+10472+9920+9368+8816+8264+7712)/12 = 10748 
* Backdash+crouching: (13784+13232+12680+12128+11576+11024+8624+0)/8 = 10381 (8 frame pattern = fastest one)

That is why Soma jumps again and again.
Crouching is used as an alternative move method,
when Soma is on a downslope, or when Soma wants to jump earlier.
Sometimes, it is also used for some luck-manipulations.

Actually, I also considered about one more method, "forward, backward + backdash, release".
It has never been used since it was slower than the two methods above.

! Motion cancels

* Backdash can cancel an attack motion. It is a well-known behavior.
* Landing can cancel an attack motion of some weapons. It is a well-known behavior, too.
* Axe Armor's ability can cancel a landing motion after damage.
* To cancel Black Panther's ability just before landing can cancel a landing motion.

! Randomness

Some rooms (more precisely, enemies, backgrounds, and other effects) change the randomness on every frame, some rooms do not.

Soma can affect the randomness at least by a normal attack (changes it once),
backdashing (changes it while doing that), or turning around (changes it once).
It cannot be changed by jumping, crouching, or using a soul that I used in the run.

Backdash+crouching is a handy way to manipulate randomness without losing speed much.
The fastest way to change randomness greatly is something like autofiring the left or right key
at the right timing (I did not use such in the run, so I am quite not sure).

! Go down floating footholds without losing speed (not used)

Here is the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paUs8h3Quqg|demonstration video (youtube)].

I just discovered it after I finished the run, so I cannot tell you the detail at present.
I assume that it happens under a limited pixel conditions.
This trick might improve the run a little. I hope it will because it looks good.

! Activate a switch behind the wall (not used)

One of famous glitches. The Cutall/Cinquedea/Alucard Sword's special attack is teleporting behind an enemy and stabbing it.
By utilizing that, you can activate a switch, which is on the other side of the wall.

! Infinite jump glitch (not used)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoyLggIDa9g

I don't know the detail since I have never had a look at it.

! Zipping: General info

When Soma goes outside the room, the game writes "visited" flag to abnormal location.
As a result, it causes various things like the run has done.

In other words, the write address is determined from Soma's location.
I studied how to calculate the exact write address from Soma's position,
and wrote up a lua script which shows the write address in realtime.
It definitely helped me to consider the optimal route of the zipping part.

 -- Address view for memory writing with zipping
 -- Open the memory viewer to see what's actually going on.
 
 if not emu then
   error("This script runs under DeSmuME.")
 end
 
 -- require("bit")
 local bit = {}
 bit.band = AND
 bit.bor  = OR
 bit.bxor = XOR
 function bit.lshift(num, shift) return SHIFT(num, -shift) end
 function bit.rshift(num, shift) return SHIFT(num,  shift) end
 
 function cvdosPosToMapFlag(x, y)
   x, y = x % 256, y % 256
 
   local xl, xh = x % 16, math.floor(x / 16) % 16
   local i = (y * 16) + (xh * 46 * 16) + xl
   local pos = 0x20F6E34 + math.floor(i / 8)
   local mask = math.pow(2, math.floor(i % 8))
   return pos, mask
 end
 
 gui.register(function()
   local x = memory.readbyte(0x0210F018)
   local y = memory.readbyte(0x0210F014)
   local i = (y * 16) + x
   local pos, mask = cvdosPosToMapFlag(x, y)
   agg.text(140, 5, string.format("%08X:%02x", pos, mask))
   agg.text(140, 24, string.format("[%04X-%04X]", cvdosPosToMapFlag(x - (x % 0x10), 0) % 0x10000, cvdosPosToMapFlag(bit.bor(x, 0x0f), 255) % 0x10000))
   agg.text(140, 43, string.format("[%04X-%04X]", cvdosPosToMapFlag(x - (x % 0x10) + 0x10, 0) % 0x10000, cvdosPosToMapFlag(bit.bor(x, 0x0f) + 0x10, 255) % 0x10000))
   agg.text(140, 62, string.format("(%03d/%X,%03d)", x, x % 16, y))
 end)

Note: As you can see in the run, Soma can move through the wall by sliding.

! Zipping: The Succubus glitch and its variations

All of these glitches cancels a special attack halfway to go into the wall.
The difference is only how to cancel an attack.

The steps to achieve the most famous Succubus glitch are:
# Equip Cutall/Cinquedea/Alucard Sword and Succubus
# Use its special attack then cancel the motion by Succubus immediately
# Walk/Attack for about 2.5 seconds (do not stop, jump, backdash, and so on. It's important)
# Use the special attack again against the wall
# The special attack will be canceled in the wall if it succeed

Axe also can be used to perform the glitch. Here is a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7eTxjuXPsA|demonstration video (youtube)].
When you use Axe, you'll need to switch your equipment during the glitch, because Axe's special attack is too long.

Axe also can be used to perform the glitch. However, you'll need to unequip the Axe once
after you used a special attack (it's good to use Doppelganger to unequip a weapon quickly, by the way),
because Axe's special attack is too long.

A cutscene after the boss fight also cancels the special attack (it's the core of the run).
It can be used earlier since it doesn't require a Succubus soul.

Additionally, there are some special locations you can perform the zipping
(flat ground + door, narrow gap + Skeleton Ape): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkohuZnKPAg

Also, I posted [=forum/p/204329#204329|some info about cheat codes] before.

!! Stage by stage comments

! Prologue

In fact, the first Skeleton can be defeated 1 frame faster, by not jumping at second backdash and sliding earlier.

Golem battle is one of my favorite parts. Soma attacks him with insane speed.

! Lost Village - Up to Flying Armor

Actually, Soma moves faster than a bone of Skeleton soul. So it's rather difficult to throw a bone optimally. After all, I tested all patterns I came up with. I am not so smart :P

The Axe Armor room is very luck-manipulative room. You need to manipulate the randomness to obtain Axe Armor soul and Axe, and also to manipulate Zombies' positions.

I had never thought that I would invent such a odd route.
In fact, before I met DeSmuME-rerecording, I had never considered about the speedrun of the game.

One day, I wanted to try recording a DS TAS movie with a new emulator,
so I TASed the very beginning part of this game (the first battle against three enemies) just for curiosity.
I learned some of the basic mechanisms of the game through the recording, and
it told me that I can improve [=forum/p/200512#200512|Atma's demonstration TAS in the forum].
This is why I started working on the game suddenly. I had never expected that I would make a Castlevania TAS.

After I decided to work on the game, I watched [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4714qAvk4|Groobo's semi-TAS video]
on YouTube (and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa0GjrK6KoY|Satoryu's non tool-assisted speedrun]).

The video completes the game in 28:58, by utilizing famous two glitches.
One is a way to open a gate from the opposite side of a switch by Cutall's special attack,
and the other is the one called "Succubus glitch" which allows us to go through/into a wall,
and get a bunch of souls and items (details are described later).
My original aim was to optimize his speedrun, and I assumed the completion time would be 20+ minutes at best.

However, a revolution happens by chance.
When I was playing with Succubus glitch to understand how it works, I noticed that a zipping could be performed with Axe.
On the other hand, I guessed that a cutscene after a boss battle also can interrupt a special attack.
I tried to perform that at Flying Armor battle with Axe, and I proved that my guess was true.
