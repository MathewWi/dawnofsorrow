Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is a one of famous Castlevania games, and it is also the sequel to [1129M|Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (GBA)].

This run aims for the fastest time to complete the game with the good ending, on normal difficulty.
The run starts with no predefined save, but it completes the game in mm minutes and ss.ms seconds,
by utilizing a variant of a famous zipping glitch.
The in-game completion time of this run should be 00:mm:ss (xx frames),
but since game timers have been overwritten by a glitch,
it is shown differently after the game has been completed.

I'd never thought that I would invent such a odd route.
In fact, before I met DeSmuME-rerecording, I had never considered about the speedrun of the game.

One day, I wanted to try recording a DS TAS movie with a new emulator,
so I TASed the very beginning part of this game (the first battle against three enemies) just for curiosity.
I learned some of the basic mechanisms of the game through the recording, and
it told me that I can improve [=forum/p/200512#200512|Atma's demonstration TAS in the forum].
This is why I started working on the game suddenly. I had never expected that I would make a Castlevania TAS.

After I decided to work on the game, I watched [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4714qAvk4|Groobo's semi-TAS video]
on YouTube (and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa0GjrK6KoY|Satoryu's non tool-assisted speedrun]).

The video completes the game in 28:58, by utilizing famous two glitches.
One is a way to open a gate from the opposite side of a switch by Cutall's special attack,
and the other is the one called "Succubus glitch" which allows us to go through/into a wall,
and get a bunch of souls and items (details are described later).
My original aim was to optimize his speedrun, and I assumed the completion time would be 20+ minutes at best.

However, a revolution happens by chance.
When I was playing with Succubus glitch to understand how it works, I noticed that a zipping could be performed with Axe.
